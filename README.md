### Java
**Voter Simulation System**: [github.com/kasarrine/voterproject](https://github.com/kasarrine/voterproject)\
*Video Demo*: [youtu.be/85LGPLAMdiY](youtu.be/85LGPLAMdiY)
> Senior Group Project for Software Engineering.\
> The objective was to develop a system for simulating a voting system in the United States
> that was expandable in the future. Developed a custom backend to be used as a database system, which allowed for multiple databases to
> be created that stored eligible voter and candidate info. On the frontend, created a custom GUI in Swing for eligible voters to register and vote.
> Also created a separate Admin GUI for candidates to be added to a ballot.

> 2. Counts the number of unique sender occurances in each of the individual logs and outputs to the terminal.
> 3. Calculates the time it takes to send a ping from one device to another (connected by ID) and outputs the duration to the terminal.
