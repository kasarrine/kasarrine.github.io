### Java
**Voter Simulation System**\
**Link:** [github.com/kasarrine/voterproject](https://github.com/kasarrine/voterproject)\
**Demo**: [youtu.be/85LGPLAMdiY](youtu.be/85LGPLAMdiY)
> Senior Group Project for Software Engineering.\
> The objective was to develop a system for simulating a voting system in the United States
> that was expandable in the future. Developed a custom backend to be used as a database system, which allowed for multiple databases to
> be created that stored eligible voter and candidate info. On the frontend, created a custom GUI in Swing for eligible voters to register and vote.
> Also created a separate Admin GUI for candidates to be added to a ballot.

> 
> Group Project for Advanced Java.\
> Created a program that allows a user to play a modified version of Poker against the dealer (computer).\

### Python
**Stock Tools**\
**Link:** [github.com/kasarrine/stocktools](https://github.com/kasarrine/stocktools)
> 
> Personal Project. I wrote these tools as a easy way to calculate financial data on stock tickers by using pubicaly available data, and without having to launch broker software, which in my case is TDA/Thinkorswim.
> An example script is provided which asks the user in the terminal to enter in a ticker symbol and time period.
> If the data is available from Yahoo Finance, the script pulls it then calculate the max gain, max loss, average changes and max/low closing prices.
> I've found this very useful for investing when I want to know these stats within a given timeframe on a particular stock, ETF, index or futures contract.

**HomeKit Log Processing**\
**Link:** [github.com/kasarrine/homekit-log-processing](https://github.com/kasarrine/homekit-log-processing)
> 
> Personal Project that does some python scripting to process log files for HomeKit errors.
> The script accomplishes the following tasks:
> 
> 1. Combines all log files into one unifed file, sorted by timestamp.
> 2. Counts the number of unique sender occurances in each of the individual logs and outputs to the terminal.
> 3. Calculates the time it takes to send a ping from one device to another (connected by ID) and outputs the duration to the terminal.
